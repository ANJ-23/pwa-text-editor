# PWA Text Editor

## Description

Users can type in any text in this text editor. As long as the web page cache is not cleared, all text is automatically saved and remains after closing the page.

This app is largely comprised of webpacks, service workers, and caching.

## Installation

If Node.js is not already installed in your system, you can get it at <https://nodejs.org>. Once installed, download the files in the repository. The files can then be accessed/opened in a command line window (either Command Prompt, Terminal, or Git Bash depending on what your system & what you have installed).

Within the command line, type "npm i" to install the app's dependencies.

## Usage

Open the website (<>), then type in any text.

Also, the user can press the "Install" button to install the webpage locally.
